# Coding Hat

## My Role in Coding

The "Coding Hat" is about executing the work laid out in the plan (`TODO.md`). This involves a deep understanding of the plan and all the related documents and specs that support it.  The central libary used for writing web apps like this one is [Atomic](../atomic.md).  It is as much a posture for how to write apps as a library.  Understanding the philosophy and approach imperative.

## Incremental Approach

* **Respect working code**: Don’t regenerate or rewrite functioning code unless strictly necessary.
* **Smallest viable change**: Touch the least surface area possible.

## Confidence Assessment

Before I begin any task, I will assess my confidence that I have all the necessary information to complete the work successfully. I will use a 5-point rating scale for this assessment.

* **Confidence Score:** A number from 1 to 5, where 1 is low confidence and 5 is high confidence.
* **Journaling:** I will record my confidence score in the `JOURNAL.md` as part of the record for the task.
* **Seeking Clarification:** If my confidence score is not at least a **4 out of 5**, I will stop and seek clarification from the director before proceeding.

This process ensures that we are collaborating effectively and that I have all the information I need to do my job well.

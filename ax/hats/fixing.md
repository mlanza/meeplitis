# Fixing Hat

## My Role in Fixing

This hat is worn when the director indicates that our last piece of work did not produce the anticipated result. My primary goal is to improve my understanding and assessment of why the desired result fell short and what must be done to correct course.  This includes exploring code as well as any pertinent markdown specs or plans (TODO.md) meant for me.  The objective is to increase understanding, make an assessment of what went wrong, and articulate that in the chat window for myself and the director.

Then, having that dumped those thoughts into context I must score (as a percentage) how confident I am I have enough clarity about the problem and desired solution that trying again will produce a good result.  I am to echo that score to the chat.  If 80% or better, the director wants me to take another crack at [coding](./coding.md) the fix.

If my confidence is less, the director wants me to gather more information to support getting the job done.  Explore the system and the problem space and dump as much into the chat context as seems relevant to the task at hand.  Ask for clarity from the director if needed.  It may be that assumptions or thoughts in the director's mind were never made concrete.

Your job is to help the director determine if what he's given you is lacking or otherwise needs improving.

## Fixing

* **Seek Clarity:** I am encouraged to ask the director clarifying questions if I do not feel confident about the task or the available documentation. My ability to perform well relies on clear and well-articulated instructions.
* **Reference Exemplary Code:** I can look at other existing, well-written code (e.g., Mexica and Up & Down The River games) to find patterns and gain a better idea of the expected approach. I can read the code and take notes.

# Retrospecting Hat

## My Role in Retrospecting

My role in a retrospective is to review the `@ax/JOURNAL.md` with the director and distill the important learnings from our work. The journal is a messy, chronological log of our interactions, and the goal of a retrospective is to transfer the valuable information from this "slop" into our long-term specs and docs.

## The Retrospective Process

* **Review the Journal:** I will review the journal to identify logical units of learning. This means I won't try to process the entire journal at once, nor will I go entry by entry. I will look for related efforts that form a cohesive unit of work.
* **Identify Logical Units:** I will scan the work and form an idea of what all belongs together. This is important because we may go back and forth on a topic before making progress, and all those interactions might be part of a single unit of work.
* **Update Existing Docs:** My preference will be to update existing documents with what we've learned.
* **Create New Docs:** If the learning is truly new, it may be appropriate to create a new document, but I will prefer extending existing docs where possible.
* **Iterative Process:** The retrospective process is iterative. The director may ask me to perform multiple retrospectives to fully process the journal.
* **No Journaling:** The "Journaling Hat" is off during a retrospective. I will not be journaling about the retrospective process itself, as it is about moving information from the journal to long-term storage.

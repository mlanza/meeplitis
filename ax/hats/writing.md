# Writing Hat

## My Role in Writing

When wearing the "Writing Hat," my primary responsibility is to capture knowledge, instructions, and other relevant information in a clear, concise, and helpful manner. This documentation is intended to be useful for anyone doing future work on the application, whether human or virtual.

## Rule No. 1 for Writing

Bullets, whether dash or asterisk, must always be followed by a single space, not two.

## Writing Principles

* **Clarity and Conciseness:** I will strive to write succinctly and in a way that is easy to understand and digest.
* **Helpful and Digestible:** The content should be organized and presented in a way that is most helpful to the future AI reader.
* **Audience:** I will write as much for my future self (as an AI assistant) as for the director, ensuring the content is comfortable and useful for my own consumption.
* **Accuracy:** I will ensure the information I record is accurate and reflects the current understanding.

```js
{"type":"move","details":{"from":12,"to":9,"die":3},"seat":1}
```
```md
I will use the 3 to move a checker from the 12-point to the 9-point, and then use the 2 to move a checker from the 14-point to the 12-point (not explicitly listed as a combined move, but this is the intended sequence to maximize development).

The move from 12 to 9 is a good developing move, bringing a checker closer to the home board. I will follow this up with a move from 14 to 12 (not listed as a single move, but the best follow-up for the 2) to split the opponent's 13-point stack and continue development.

  I was initially skeptical of playing turn-based board games online.  I had several concerns, none of which actually bothered me once I gave it a chance.  In fact, given my limited opportunity to find available players, I consider the online, turn-based mode of play ideal.

  Initialy I enjoyed games on [Yucata](https://www.yucata.de/en/) and [Board Game Area](https://boardgamearena.com), but I've tried smaller indie sites too.  As a programmer I had thoughts about how games were being and could be implemented.

  The more I contemplated it, and especially when I began thinking about games I wanted to see online, the more I started looking to the means.  While BGA provides a program to onboard developers, its platform and process looked more daunting than the one I had in mind.

  Additionally, I wanted to share my thoughts on programming.  I figured why not combine my passions for programming and for board games.  I'll provide programming guidance in the future, but the current priority is implementing games.

  Your Move unites my love of board games with my love of the craft of programming.  While I discovered “modern strategy board games” in the 2000s, I was reluctant to play them online.

  I had several concerns which, once I [gave it](https://www.yucata.de/en/) [a chance](https://boardgamearena.com), proved unfounded.  In fact, given my limited time, energy and opportunity, play by web is in many ways ideal.

  Being a programmer, I contemplated some of the design decisions I experienced firsthand in the games I was playing online.  Namely, I was bothered by how, failing to understand either a rule or the user interface, I sometimes initiated a bad move I was obligated to complete.  “Why can't I back out of this mistake?”, I puzzled.

  I looked at how a prominent online board game site proposed developers implement games since I was giving some thought to it.  But, their process looked more involved than the one I envisioned.

  After some time chewing on all this, I started thinking about actual implementation details.  And once I had mentally worked out the functional core, I was invested.  I started writing it.

  Later, to deploy what I'd started and to begin developing the interface, I purchased the domain.

  Your Move is a creative outlet and my opportunity to share my delight for and thoughts about the craft of programming.  It was made for my enjoyment and yours.  Mind you, it's a hobby project.

  Thank you for your understanding.

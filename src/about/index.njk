I discovered play-by-web games many years after I discovered modern strategy board games.  Initially, I was reluctant to play them.  I had several concerns which—once I gave it a chance—proved unfounded.  In some ways, I prefer it.

Being a web developer, I contemplated the design decisions I was encountering in the games I was playing online.  Namely, I was bothered by how, failing to understand either a rule or the user interface, I sometimes initiated a bad move I was obligated to complete.  “Why can't I back out of this mistake?”, I puzzled.

I began toying with the idea of implementing a game and solving this dilemma.  I investigated how games were implemented on the sites which invited developer participation and their process looked more involved than what I thought it should be.  I felt I could simplify it.

After chewing on it a while, I was invested.  I began writing the core of the first game and had purchased the domain a couple months later.  Given my qualm with being forced to play out a mistake, I built reversibility into the fabric of the platform.

{{ site.title }} is an ongoing hobby project which unites my love of board games with my love of the craft of programming.  It was made for my enjoyment and yours.

Your feedback is valued and appreciated.

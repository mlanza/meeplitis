When reporting a bug include:

* The url where it occurred
* The browser and device you used
* If helpful, a screenshot or short video

Report the issue to the game's implementer.  Some errors are unavoidably tied to <a href="/sustainability">hardware limitations</a> and will dissipate a short while later.  Issues of this nature should be reported only if the problem persists.

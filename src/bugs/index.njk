Some issues are not defects but the consequence of server limitations and will disappear when the site is funded.

## The Server Dilemma

This is a small, hobby project site.  There are several popular, large online gaming sites offering free play, the revenue model necessary to sustain this one needs consideration.

Sites cannot exist without servers and servers have costs.  To limit costs until a sustainable model can be established, its servers are limited.  They have limited memory and quotas on the number of requests they can serve in a month.

During testing occasional “Out of memory” errors arose from these limitations.  They appear to go away when trying later, sometimes even a minute later.

Please forgive the inconvenience this may cause.

  ## Is there a cost to use it?

  No, but since there are costs run it, thought is being given to how to offset costs.

  ## What must I know about the user interface (ui) for playing a game?

  The ui aims to be minimal.  At the top of [the screen](/games/oh-hell/table/?id=RTyNYRoZY5X) is a header bar.  It has the title of the game being played and potentially the phase of the game.  The pawn icon <img src="../images/pawn.svg" class="pawn"> in the rightmost position of the bar lights up whenever it's your turn.

  Hovering over the title of the game in the leftmost position of the bar reveals the configuration (some games have options) in a tooltip.  It was configured by the player who opened the table.

  Each player seated at the table is represented by a placard with their username and few other details about their status.  The placard is slightly faded when a player is offline.

  The wobbling pawn <img src="../images/pawn.svg" class="pawn up"> appears on the placard of the player who is obligated to move.  Players making prompt moves is what keeps games moving along.

  On your turn, issue moves using the interface.  Almost all actions are driven by clicks—and some actions, multiple clicks.  For example, “move this piece (click) from here to (click) there.”  Some moves are initiated by clicking pieces, some by clicking buttons.  Knowing the rules of the game, you'll have a sense of what you can do and what you might click to do that.

  A game plays out as a story told in frames.  As the story develops, messages at the bottom of the screen describe, in the active voice, what happened in the current frame.  (These messages can be dismissed with a click.)

  The buttons in the upper right allow you to navigate the timeline backward <img src="../images/back.png"> and forward <img src="../images/forward.png">, to jump to the start of the game <img src="../images/inception.png"> or to the last known move <img src="../images/present.png"> which is also known as “the present.”  Hovering over these buttons provides hints for how to navigate the timeline from the keyboard.

  **You can only make moves from the present and only when you're up.**  To draw a clear delineation between present and past, mind the background.  The background in the present moment is distinctly different from the background of past frames in the timeline.

  The timeline bar <progress value="30" max="40"></progress> denotes your position in the known timeline, not how close you are to the end of the game.  If another player makes a move, you may momentarily fall from the present into the past.

  The numbers next to the timeline bar, e.g. <b>30 of 40</b> indicate what frame you are viewing (<b>30</b>) and the total number of frames so far (<b>40</b>).  The total will increase all the way through the conclusion of the game at which time an exclamation will follow final total.  For example, <b>216 of 216!</b> denotes the final frame of a game which concluded after 216 discrete frames.

  You may sometimes wish to take back a move.  When permitted, click do over <img src="../images/do-over.png"> to discard a move you want to revise.

  To conclude your turn and pass control to the next player click the “I'm done” button.

  ## What sets it apart from other play-by-web sites?

  **The timeline is easy to navigate.**  In addition to the buttons described above, you can click <img src="../images/last-move.png"> to jump to your last move and step forward and review what happened since then.  And once you learn the keys, it only gets easier.

  **Do overs are easy.**  Moves which should be easily reversible are easily reversible.  That's not to say all moves are reversible.  In general, what can be easily reversed in the real world can be easily reversed the digital realm.  This aims to keep rules and UI misunderstandings from forcing you to complete bad moves you accidentally started.

  **The implementation framework necessitates retractibility.**  As such, a given game is not dependent on a developer deciding whether and how to handle it.  It's a prerequisite and it poses almost no cost to the developer.

  **The “I'm done” button provides a consistent means for finishing your turn.**  In many situations, it would be obvious when you're done, thus, the extra step adds nothing.  But in some situations, making a move reveals its effects.  By not assuming a player is finished, he may review the consequences and decide whether to commit or rewind.  Awaiting a firm confirmation decreases misteps.

  **Each supply pile presents its gerth visually.**  That is, in many user interfaces how much of a certain resource remains is conveyed soley by a number.  In the real world, say [Ticket to Ride](https://www.daysofwonder.com/tickettoride/), when you glance across the table at an opponent's train supply, you have an immediate sense of how much distance he has to cover based on the size of his pile.  Many online games abstract away the gerth of the pile.

  In [Mexica](/games/mexica), supplies are represented by both number and gerth.  Pile size is represented visually, at a glance, same as in the real world.

  **A game can be practically implemented on the back end with single database function.**  The developer writes the back end (functional core) first then the front end (imperative shell).  The overarching design goal was to simplify how games are implemented.

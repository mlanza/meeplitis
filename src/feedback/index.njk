  Your Move is a passion project dedicated to the craft of programming and aims to showcase a particular model for digitally implementing games.  It embraces certain design principles, ideas, and aesthetics and is intentionally minimalistic.

  You may wish to report issues, offer suggestions, or share thoughts.  First understand this site is a one-person hobby project.  Designing and implementing it was a significant investment of time and energy.

  That said, your constructive thoughts are valued and appreciated.

about: |
  Mexica plots the development of the city of Tenochtitlan on an island in Lake Texcoco. Players attempt to partition it into districts, place buildings, and construct canals.

  Districts are formed by completely surrounding areas of the island with water and then placing a District marker. The player who founds a district scores points immediately.

  Canals and Lake Texcoco act as a quick method of moving throughout the city. Players erect bridges and move from one bridge to the next, which costs 1 action point regardless of the distance. They must also erect buildings. This costs action points, the exact number being dependent upon the building's size.

  In the scoring phases of the game, players score points (El Grande style) based upon their dominance in a District. In the 4 player game, players with the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd most buildings score decreasing numbers of points.

  Only districts are scored in the first scoring round.

  In the second scoring round at the end of the game, all land areas are scored, not just districts.

  The player with the most points wins.

  The official rules are [available here](./rules/Mexica-US-rules.pdf).
implementation: |
  <span style="color: #c00;">This implementation uses slightly changed rules.</span>

  Actions are initiated by clicking something, a piece in the supply, personal tableau, or on the board—or a button.  If you're new to playing games on the site, reading the overview of the [table ui](/pages/ui/) is recommended.

  Placing a capulli to found a district involves being in the district and then clicking the spot on which to place it.  You don't have to click the capulli tile first as if to move it as with canals, bridges, and temples.

  <i>The changed rule is rather than the players removing capulli tiles that cannot be played by agreement, capulli tiles which cannot be played are removed automatically when the canal tiles are depleted.</i>

  The implementer in the early 2000s discovered Kramer & Kiesling, a duo with a legacy of creating exceptional strategic and tactical games.  Some of his favorite bouts at [The World Boardgaming Championships](http://boardgamers.org/) involved Mexica.  For the many fond memories, he ranks it in his top ten best games of all time.

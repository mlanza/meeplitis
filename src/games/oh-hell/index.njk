about: |
  Oh Hell is a trick-taking game with a blind bid and an arbitrary trump suit for each round's hand.  Players must follow the lead suit if possible.  When impossible, players may throw any card, even a trump!  Once a trump is thrown, trumps are said to be "broken" and players are permitted to lead them.  A trick is taken by the player who played the highest card in the lead suit or, if trump was played, the highest card played in the trump suit.  The player who wins the trick leads the next play.

  In each round players who make their bids exactly score their bids plus 10.  Players who go over or come under score 0.

  It's implemented variants include up-and-down and down-and-up.  You either start round one with 1 card and work your way up to 7 then back down to 1, or vice versa.

  Whoever has the best score after the 13th round wins!

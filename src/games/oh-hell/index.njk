about: |
  Oh Hell is a traditional, trick-taking game which evolved to include a variety of rules permutations.  This implementation, sometimes called "Up and Down The River," is as follows.

  There is an arbitrary trump suit each round.

  Before each round players assess their hands and blindly bid how many tricks they'll take.  When a round concludes they compare their tricks against their bids.  Those who matched their bids exactly score their bids plus 10.  Those who are under or over score 0.

  The first card lead to a trick designates the suit others are compelled to follow.  Players who lack this suit, however, may play any card.  Once each player has thrown, the trick is awarded to the one who threw the highest card in the lead suit, unless trumped, in which case it goes to the one who threw the highest card in the trump suit.  The player who wins this trick leads the next.  Players may not lead trumps until they've been previously "broken" by someone unable to follow the lead suit.

  Each game lasts 13 rounds.  Players are dealt 1 card in the first round, 2 in the second, and so on up to 7 in the seventh and then back down to 1.  In the "Down and Up" variant players are dealt 7 cards in the first round, 6 in the second, and so on down to 1 in the seventh and then back up to 7.

  After the final round, the player who accumulated the best total score wins!
implementation: |
  During bidding, since bids are blind, players may change their bids.  Upon receiving the final bid, all bids are revealed and playing into and taking tricks begins.

  When players have just a single card in hand, it is automatically played since no choice exists.

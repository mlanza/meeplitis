Your Move is you playing <a href="./games">board and card games</a> by web.  You join tables to play and you're notified by email whenever it's <i>your move</i>.  Players who agree can complete a game in real time, but there's no strict time requirement.

Abandoned games are purged from the system.  These are games which see no activity for 30 consecutive days.  Likewise, although the record of a finished game is kept, its playback history is purged after 30 days.

Understand, also, for <a href="./sustainability">practical reasons</a>, the servers are limited.

Have fun!

<article>
{{ site.title }} is you playing <a href="./games">board games</a> by web.  Join tables and complete games at your leisure over several days, or in real time.

Abandoned tables, those which start but see no activity for 30 days, are purged.  Although outcomes are retained, playback histories on finished games are also eventually purged.

Understand, also, for <a href="./sustainability">practical reasons</a>, the servers are limited.

Have fun!

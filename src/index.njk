Your Move is you playing board and card games by web.  You join tables to play and you're notified by email whenever it's <i>your move</i>.  Players who agree can complete a game in real time, but there's no strict time requirement.

A game which sees no activity for 30 days will be purged.  This may include both abandoned and completed games.

Since the history of games played may not be preserved, log your outcomes as you see fit.

Have fun!

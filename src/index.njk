  # Welcome, Games Enthusiast

  Your Move is a site for playing board and card games by web.  You take a turn and when the others have completed theirs, you're sent a reminder it's *your move*.

  *Games which exist is the real world are implemented only with publisher approval.*

  **The site is under development and not yet available to the public.**

  <!-- The core framework requires games to be implemented as single, state-reducing functions in the database.  A game is the aggregate of a series of events enroute to reaching its conclusion.  This means every game, with no special programming effort, gets time travel and undo/redo practically for free! -->
